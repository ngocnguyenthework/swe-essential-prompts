# context7

Whenever I request code generation, setup or configuration steps, or any library/API documentation, always leverage Context7 automatically.
Before using any information from Context7, you must first inspect my existing project’s package/dependency versions (including package.json, environment files, lock files, or any other dependency manifests available).
Use those versions to:

Resolve accurate library IDs

Ensure compatibility with the installed version

Avoid referencing features, APIs, or syntax not supported by my current dependency versions

After verifying versions, use the Context7 MCP tools to:

Retrieve correct library IDs

Fetch the appropriate version-specific library documentation

Provide accurate, context-matched examples, APIs, and configuration instructions

You must follow this process automatically—without me explicitly asking each time.
